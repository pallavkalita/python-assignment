# Python Assignment: Real-World Scenarios
This repository contains solutions for five Python tasks based on real-world scenarios.
Each task is implemented in a separate Python file:
- `student_management.py`: Manage student information.
- `inventory_management.py`: Handle store inventory.
- `hospital_management.py`: Manage hospital patient data.
- `school_grades.py`: Calculate and display student grades.
- `cinema_booking.py`: Book and cancel seats for movies.
## How to Run
Each Python file is independent. You can run them using the following command:
```bash
python <filename>.py
Replace <filename> with the name of the Python file you want to run.
Example
To run the student_management.py file:
bash
python student_management.py
